# neighbor-conservation
- A computational methods for evaluate conservation of genes' neighboring relationship

### Modeling of background
- Orthologous single copy protein coding genes were used for performance evaluation
- Determination of orthologous genes: `run/orthofinder.sh`

- `scripts/scoring-context-conservation.py` scoring conservation of neighboring gene pairs
